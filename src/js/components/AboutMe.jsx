                A dedicated Front-end Developer <br /> based in Ha Noi, Viet

              <p>
                Im a Fresher Front-End Developer with a primary focus on React.
                I have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
                Tailwind, and SCSS and am seeking opportunities to apply this
                knowledge in real-world scenarios, particularly in web
                application development using React. I'm self-driven and have
                been self-learning and practicing to grasp the fundamentals of
                working with React components, state management, and routing. My
                eagerness to learn is one of my strengths, and I aspire to work
                in a team environment where I can learn from experts and
                contribute to building impressive web products.
